Consumer groups allow a group of machines or processes to coordinate access to a list of topics, distributing the load among the consumers. When a consumer fails the load is automatically distributed to other members of the group. Consumer groups __must have__ unique group ids within the cluster, from a kafka broker perspective.

Creating the consumer:

```javascript
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'my-group' })
```

Subscribing to some topics:

```javascript
await consumer.connect()

// Subscribe can be called several times
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'topic-A' })
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'topic-B' })

// It's possible to start from the beginning:
// await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'topic-C', fromBeginning: true })
```

Alternatively, you can subscribe to multiple topics at once using a RegExp:

```javascript
await consumer.connect()
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: /topic-(eu|us)-.*/i })
```

The consumer will not match topics created after the subscription. If your broker has `topic-A` and `topic-B`, you subscribe to `/topic-.*/`, then `topic-C` is created, your consumer would not be automatically subscribed to `topic-C`.

KafkaJS offers you two ways to process your data: `eachMessage` and `eachBatch`

## <a name="each-message"></a> eachMessage

The `eachMessage` handler provides a convenient and easy to use API, feeding your function one message at a time. It is implemented on top of `eachBatch`, and it will automatically commit your offsets and heartbeat at the configured interval for you. If you are just looking to get started with Kafka consumers this a good place to start.

```javascript
await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
        console.log({
            key: message.key.toString(),
            value: message.value.toString(),
            headers: message.headers,
        })
    },
})
```

## <a name="each-batch"></a> eachBatch

Some use cases require dealing with batches directly. This handler will feed your function batches and provide some utility functions to give your code more flexibility: `resolveOffset`, `heartbeat`, `isRunning`, and `commitOffsetsIfNecessary`. All resolved offsets will be automatically committed after the function is executed.

> Note: Be aware that using `eachBatch` directly is considered a more advanced use case as compared to using `eachMessage`, since you will have to understand how session timeouts and heartbeats are connected.

```javascript
await consumer.run({
    eachBatch: async ({ batch, resolveOffset, heartbeat, isRunning, isStale }) => {
        for (let message of batch.messages) {
            console.log({
                topic: batch.topic,
                partition: batch.partition,
                highWatermark: batch.highWatermark,
                message: {
                    offset: message.offset,
                    key: message.key.toString(),
                    value: message.value.toString(),
                    headers: message.headers,
                }
            })

            await resolveOffset(message.offset)
            await heartbeat()
        }
    },
})
```

* `batch.highWatermark` is the last committed offset within the topic partition. It can be useful for calculating lag.
* `eachBatchAutoResolve` configures auto-resolve of batch processing. If set to true, KafkaJS will automatically commit the last offset of the batch if `eachBatch` doesn't throw an error. Default: true.
* `resolveOffset()` is used to mark a message in the batch as processed. In case of errors, the consumer will automatically commit the resolved offsets.
* `commitOffsetsIfNecessary(offsets?)` is used to commit offsets based on the autoCommit configurations (`autoCommitInterval` and `autoCommitThreshold`). Note that auto commit won't happen in `eachBatch` if `commitOffsetsIfNecessary` is not invoked. Take a look at [autoCommit](#auto-commit) for more information.
* `uncommittedOffsets()` returns all offsets by topic-partition which have not yet been committed.
* `isStale()` returns whether the messages in the batch have been rendered stale through some other operation and should be discarded. For example, when calling [`consumer.seek`](#seek) the messages in the batch should be discarded, as they are not at the offset we seeked to.

### Example

```javascript
consumer.run({
    eachBatchAutoResolve: false,
    eachBatch: async ({ batch, resolveOffset, heartbeat, isRunning, isStale }) => {
        for (let message of batch.messages) {
            if (!isRunning() || isStale()) break
            await processMessage(message)
            await resolveOffset(message.offset)
            await heartbeat()
        }
    }
})
```

In the example above, if the consumer is shutting down in the middle of the batch, the remaining messages won't be resolved and therefore not committed. This way, you can quickly shut down the consumer without losing/skipping any messages. If the batch goes stale for some other reason (like calling `consumer.seek`) none of the remaining messages are processed either.

## <a name="concurrent-processing"></a> Partition-aware concurrency

By default, [`eachMessage`](Consuming.md#each-message) is invoked sequentially for each message in each partition. In order to concurrently process several messages per once, you can increase the `partitionsConsumedConcurrently` option:

```javascript
consumer.run({
    partitionsConsumedConcurrently: 3, // Default: 1
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
        // This will be called up to 3 times concurrently
    },
})
```

Messages in the same partition are still guaranteed to be processed in order, but messages from multiple partitions can be processed at the same time. If `eachMessage` consists of asynchronous work, such as network requests or other I/O, this can improve performance. If `eachMessage` is entirely synchronous, this will make no difference.

The same thing applies if you are using [`eachBatch`](Consuming.md#each-batch). Given `partitionsConsumedConcurrently > 1`, you will be able to process multiple batches concurrently.

A guideline for setting `partitionsConsumedConcurrently` would be that it should not be larger than the number of partitions consumed. Depending on whether or not your workload is CPU bound, it may also not benefit you to set it to a higher number than the number of logical CPU cores. A recommendation is to start with a low number and measure if increasing leads to higher throughput.

## <a name="auto-commit"></a> autoCommit

The messages are always fetched in batches from Kafka, even when using the `eachMessage` handler. All resolved offsets will be committed to Kafka after processing the whole batch.

Committing offsets periodically during a batch allows the consumer to recover from group rebalances, stale metadata and other issues before it has completed the entire batch. However, committing more often increases network traffic and slows down processing. Auto-commit offers more flexibility when committing offsets; there are two flavors available:

`autoCommitInterval`: The consumer will commit offsets after a given period, for example, five seconds. Value in milliseconds. Default: `null`

```javascript
consumer.run({
  autoCommitInterval: 5000,
  // ...
})
```

`autoCommitThreshold`: The consumer will commit offsets after resolving a given number of messages, for example, a hundred messages. Default: `null`

```javascript
consumer.run({
  autoCommitThreshold: 100,
  // ...
})
```

Having both flavors at the same time is also possible, the consumer will commit the offsets if any of the use cases (interval or number of messages) happens.

`autoCommit`: Advanced option to disable auto committing altogether. Instead, you can [manually commit offsets](#manual-commits). Default: `true`

## <a name="manual-commits"></a> Manual committing

When disabling [`autoCommit`](#auto-commit) you can still manually commit message offsets, in a couple of different ways:

- By using the `commitOffsetsIfNecessary` method available in the `eachBatch` callback. The `commitOffsetsIfNecessary` method will still respect the other autoCommit options if set.
- By [sending message offsets in a transaction](Transactions.md#offsets).
- By using the `commitOffsets` method of the consumer (see below).

The `consumer.commitOffsets` is the lowest-level option and will ignore all other auto commit settings, but in doing so allows the committed offset to be set to any offset and committing various offsets at once. This can be useful, for example, for building an processing reset tool. It can only be called after `consumer.run`. Committing offsets does not change what message we'll consume next once we've started consuming, but instead is only used to determine **from which place to start**. To immediately change from what offset you're consuming messages, you'll want to [seek](#seek), instead.

```javascript
consumer.run({
    autoCommit: false,
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
        // Process the message somehow
    },
})

consumer.commitOffsets([
  { topic: 'topic-A', partition: 0, offset: '1' },
  { topic: 'topic-A', partition: 1, offset: '3' },
  { topic: 'topic-B', partition: 0, offset: '2' }
])
```

Note that you don't *have* to store consumed offsets in Kafka, but instead store it in a storage mechanism of your own choosing. That's an especially useful approach when the results of consuming a message are written to a datastore that allows atomically writing the consumed offset with it, like for example a SQL database. When possible it can make the consumption fully atomic and give "exactly once" semantics that are stronger than the default "at-least once" semantics you get with Kafka's offset commit functionality.

The usual usage pattern for offsets stored outside of Kafka is as follows:

- Run the consumer with `autoCommit` disabled.
- Store a message's `offset + 1` in the store together with the results of processing. `1` is added to prevent that same message from being consumed again.
- Use the externally stored offset on restart to [seek](#seek) the consumer to it.

## <a name="from-beginning"></a> fromBeginning

The consumer group will use the latest committed offset when starting to fetch messages. If the offset is invalid or not defined, `fromBeginning` defines the behavior of the consumer group. This can be configured when subscribing to a topic:

```javascript
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'test-topic', fromBeginning: true })
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'other-topic', fromBeginning: false })
```

When `fromBeginning` is `true`, the group will use the earliest offset. If set to `false`, it will use the latest offset. The default is `false`.

kafka.consumer({
  groupId: <String>,
  partitionAssigners: <Array>,
  sessionTimeout: <Number>,
  rebalanceTimeout: <Number>,

## <a name="pause-resume"></a> Pause & Resume

In order to pause and resume consuming from one or more topics, the `Consumer` provides the methods `pause` and `resume`. It also provides the `paused` method to get the list of all paused topics. Note that pausing a topic means that it won't be fetched in the next cycle. You may still receive messages for the topic within the current batch.

Calling `pause` with a topic that the consumer is not subscribed to is a no-op, calling `resume` with a topic that is not paused is also a no-op.

Example: A situation where this could be useful is when an external dependency used by the consumer is under too much load. Here we want to `pause` consumption from a topic when this happens, and after a predefined interval we `resume` again:

```javascript
await consumer.connect()
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'jobs' })

await consumer.run({ eachMessage: async ({ topic, message }) => {
    try {
        await sendToDependency(message)
    } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof TooManyRequestsError) {
            consumer.pause([{ topic }])
            setTimeout(() => consumer.resume([{ topic }]), e.retryAfter * 1000)
        }

        throw e
    }
}})
```

For finer-grained control, specific partitions of topics can also be paused, rather than the whole topic. The ability to pause and resume on a per-partition basis, means it can be used to isolate the consuming (and processing) of messages.

Example: in combination with [consuming messages per partition concurrently](#concurrent-processing), it can prevent having to stop processing all partitions because of a slow process in one of the other partitions.

```javascript
consumer.run({
    partitionsConsumedConcurrently: 3, // Default: 1
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
      // This will be called up to 3 times concurrently
        try {
            await sendToDependency(message)
        } catch (e) {
            if (e instanceof TooManyRequestsError) {
                consumer.pause([{ topic, partitions: [partition] }])
                // Other partitions will keep fetching and processing, until if / when
                // they also get throttled
                setTimeout(() => {
                    consumer.resume([{ topic, partitions: [partition] }])
                    // Other partitions that are paused will continue to be paused
                }, e.retryAfter * 1000)
            }

            throw e
        }
    },
})
```

It's possible to access the list of paused topic partitions using the `paused` method.

```javascript
const pausedTopicPartitions = consumer.paused()

for (const topicPartitions of pausedTopicPartitions) {
  const { topic, partitions } = topicPartitions
  console.log({ topic, partitions })
}
```

## <a name="seek"></a> Seek

To move the offset position in a topic/partition the `Consumer` provides the method `seek`. This method has to be called after the consumer is initialized and is running (after consumer#run).

```javascript
await consumer.connect()
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'example' })

// you don't need to await consumer#run
consumer.run({ eachMessage: async ({ topic, message }) => true })
consumer.seek({ topic: 'example', partition: 0, offset: 12384 })
```

Upon seeking to an offset, any messages in active batches are marked as stale and discarded, making sure the next message read for the partition is from the offset sought to. Make sure to check `isStale()` before processing a message using [the `eachBatch` interface](#each-batch) of `consumer.run`.

## <a name="custom-partition-assigner"></a> Custom partition assigner

It's possible to configure the strategy the consumer will use to distribute partitions amongst the consumer group. KafkaJS has a round robin assigner configured by default.

A partition assigner is a function which returns an object with the following interface:

```javascript
const MyPartitionAssigner = ({ cluster }) => ({
    name: 'MyPartitionAssigner',
    version: 1,
    async assign({ members, topics }) {},
    protocol({ topics }) {}
})
```

The method `assign` has to return an assignment plan with partitions per topic. A partition plan consists of a list of `memberId` and `memberAssignment`. The member assignment has to be encoded, use the `MemberAssignment` utility for that. Example:

```javascript
const { AssignerProtocol: { MemberAssignment } } = require('kafkajs')

const MyPartitionAssigner = ({ cluster }) => ({
    version: 1,
    async assign({ members, topics }) {
        // perform assignment
        return myCustomAssignmentArray.map(memberId => ({
            memberId,
            memberAssignment: MemberAssignment.encode({
                version: this.version,
                assignment: assignment[memberId],
            })
        }))
    }
})
```

The method `protocol` has to return `name` and `metadata`. Metadata has to be encoded, use the `MemberMetadata` utility for that. Example:

```javascript
const { AssignerProtocol: { MemberMetadata } } = require('kafkajs')

const MyPartitionAssigner = ({ cluster }) => ({
    name: 'MyPartitionAssigner',
    version: 1,
    protocol({ topics }) {
        return {
            name: this.name,
            metadata: MemberMetadata.encode({
            version: this.version,
            topics,
            }),
        }
    }
})
```

Your `protocol` method will probably look like the example, but it's not implemented by default because extra data can be included as `userData`. Take a look at the `MemberMetadata#encode` for more information.

Once your assigner is done, add it to the list of assigners. It's important to keep the default assigner there to allow the old consumers to have a common ground with the new consumers when deploying.

```javascript
const { PartitionAssigners: { roundRobin } } = require('kafkajs')

kafka.consumer({
    groupId: 'my-group',
    partitionAssigners: [
        MyPartitionAssigner,
        roundRobin
    ]
})
```

## <a name="describe-group"></a> Describe group

> **Experimental** - This feature may be removed or changed in new versions of KafkaJS

Returns metadata for the configured consumer group, example:

```javascript
const data = await consumer.describeGroup()
// {
//  errorCode: 0,
//  groupId: 'consumer-group-id-f104efb0e1044702e5f6',
//  members: [
//    {
//      clientHost: '/172.19.0.1',
//      clientId: 'test-3e93246fe1f4efa7380a',
//      memberAssignment: Buffer,
//      memberId: 'test-3e93246fe1f4efa7380a-ff87d06d-5c87-49b8-a1f1-c4f8e3ffe7eb',
//      memberMetadata: Buffer,
//    },
//  ],
//  protocol: 'RoundRobinAssigner',
//  protocolType: 'consumer',
//  state: 'Stable',
// },
```

## <a name="compression"></a> Compression

KafkaJS only support GZIP natively, but [other codecs can be supported](Producing.md#compression-other).
