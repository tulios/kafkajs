title: Instrumentation Events
original_id: instrumentation-events
---

Some operations are instrumented using `EventEmitter`. To receive the events use the method `consumer.on()`, `producer.on()` and `admin.on()`, example:

```javascript
const { HEARTBEAT } = consumer.events
const removeListener = consumer.on(HEARTBEAT, e => console.log(`heartbeat at ${e.timestamp}`))

// Remove the listener by invoking removeListener()
```

The listeners are always async, even when using regular functions. The consumer will never block when executing your listeners. Errors in the listeners won't affect the consumer.

Instrumentation Event:

```javascript
{
  id: <Number>,
  type: <String>,
  timestamp: <Number>,
  payload: <Object>
}
```

In the case of CRASH, the consumer will try to restart itself. If the error is not retriable, the consumer will instead stop and exit. If your application wants to react to the error, such as by cleanly shutting down resources,</br>restarting the consumer itself, or exiting the process entirely, it should listen to the CRASH event. |

Whenever the size of the queue changes, this event is emitted. |
| RECEIVED_UNSUBSCRIBED_TOPICS | {`groupId`, `generationId`, `memberId`, `assignedTopics`, `topicsSubscribed`, `topicsNotSubscribed`} | Event emitted when some members of your consumer group are subscribed to some topics, and some other members of the group are subscribed to a different set of topics. |
